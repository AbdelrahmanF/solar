Introduction
=====

The cost of solar panels has dropped to below $1 per watt.  However, the cost
per installed watt is significantly higher, at over
[$5 / watt in California](http://www.californiasolarstatistics.ca.gov/) in 2014.
This project attempts to provide open source specifications of various components
of photovolatic systems, in the hope that providing such open source hardware
will help increase competition and drive down the price of these components.

First project is the design of a Maximum Power Point Tracker for a single solar
panel.  A commercial example of this product is the
[SolarEdge series of power optimizers](http://www.solaredge.us/groups/us/powerbox-power-optimizer).
