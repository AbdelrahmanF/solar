Introduction
=====

The cost of solar panels has dropped to below $1 per watt.  However, the cost
per installed watt is significantly higher, at over
[$5 / watt in California](http://www.californiasolarstatistics.ca.gov/) in 2014.
This project attempts provide open source specifications of various components
of photovolatic systems.

First project is the design of a Maximum Power Point Tracker for a single solar
panel.  A commercial example of this product is the
[SolarEdge series of power optimizers](http://www.solaredge.us/groups/us/powerbox-power-optimizer).
